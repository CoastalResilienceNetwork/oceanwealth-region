            Each item listed in the sidebar is a browser-based Ocean Wealth "app."  These are intended to address a specific coastal issue for resilience, restoration and adaptation planning.  You can have multiple apps running at the same time; simply minimize an active app (the icon will stay blue) and open others to view additional data and information.  Hover over any app in the list to see a short description or open them to see an informative info graphic.
