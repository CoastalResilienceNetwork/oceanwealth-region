      <abstract>Reef UnitsWe used coral reef data from the Millennium Coral Reef Mapping Project as a consistent and high-resolution representation of coral reef locations throughout the study area. Prior to using these data, all coral reef locations were reviewed and edited by in-country reef experts. We developed a gridded reef map (8x8 km) and grouped contiguous clusters of coral habitat into 423 distinct reef units. Given the close proximity of the coral reefs within each reef unit, it was assumed that each unit was internally connected. Centrality MeasuresWe used a centrality measure to represent conservation value. In our connectivity network, we transformed the edge weights using x– connection strength, where xis next whole number greater than the largest connection strength value. In this way, connection strength is the same rank-order as geographic distance, a prerequisite of these centrality measures. We calculated betweenness, closeness, and eigenvectorcentrality measures using values in our reef network. Betweennesscentrality is calculated by determining the number of times a particular node serves as the shortest path between all the other pairs of nodes in the network. This measure can be used to identify important stepping-stones that maintain connectivity in a network. Closenesscentrality values are higher for a particular node when its total distance to all other nodes in the network is lower. This measure indicates how close a particular node is to the other nodes in the network. Finally, eigenvectorcentrality is a measure of the influence of a node within a network. This measure determines first how connected each node is in the network and assigns weights to each node based on that score, then calculates a centrality score based on the weights for each node’s connected nodes.</abstract>
      <purpose>We used NOAA’s Real Time Ocean Forecasting System (RTOFS) ocean circulation model and regional coral reef data to simulate eight coral spawning events from 2008-2011, applying a 30-day pelagic larval duration and 20% mortality rate. Larval dispersal patterns were analyzed between reef units across jurisdictional marine zones in order to identify spatial relationships between larval sources and destinations within countries and territories across the region. Ocean current data were acquired from the NOAA Real-Time Ocean Forecast System (RTOFS) database. RTOFS constitutes predicted circulation values while integrating tidal patterns and is based on the Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM). These data are a basin-scale ocean forecast system for the northern Atlantic and part of the southern Atlantic Ocean, using a variable size grid resolution ranging from 4 to 17 km, and extending from 25°S to 72°N and to 98°W to 16°E. Evaluations of the RTOFS performance indicate that predictions compare well to historical observations at regional scales.</purpose>
