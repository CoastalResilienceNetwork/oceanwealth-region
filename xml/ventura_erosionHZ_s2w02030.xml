      <abstract>This polygon represents the coastal erosion hazard zone for the medium sea level rise (93 cm by 2100, relative to 2010) and the "continuation of existing wave climate" scenario at the 2030 planning horizon. The coastal erosion hazard zones incorporate three components of potential future erosion: a historic trend in erosion, additional erosion caused by sea level rise, and the potential erosion impact of a large storm wave event. The planning horizons were selected based on guidance from the Coastal Resilience Ventura steering committee.This feature is one in a series of coastal flood and erosion hazard zones developed as part of the Coastal Resilience Ventura project. For detailed documentation about how these hazard zones were developed please see "Coastal Resilience Ventura: Technical Report for Coastal Hazards Mapping," a report prepared by ESA PWA for The Nature Conservancy.</abstract>
      <purpose>This polygon was created for estimating the impacts of future coastal erosion on the Ventura County coastline.</purpose>
