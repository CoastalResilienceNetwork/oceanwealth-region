      <abstract>These areas represent coastal populations greater than 500 people based on the Landscan 2012 population grid (1km) and a search radius or 2km. These areas were used as the basis for indetifying where coastal habitats could play a role in reducing coastal exposure using the InVEST Coastal Vulnerability model that produces a qualitative estimate of relatively high or low exposure to erosion and inundation during storms. By coupling these results with global population information, the model can show areas along a given coastline where humans are most vulnerable to storm waves and surge. Once vulnerable portions of the coastline have been identified (using a threshold derived from vulnerability), the Coastal Protection Model(s) is used to evaluate the protective benefit of natural coastal protection assets.</abstract>
      <purpose>These data layers were created by The Nature Conservancy’s Caribbean Program and the University of California-Santz Cruz’s Center for Integrated Spatial Research for the Mapping Ocean Wealth project in October 2015. The goal of this project is to use science, communications, and policy work to visualize and quantify the ocean’s ecosystem, so that we can make smarter investments and decisions for the ocean of tomorrow. In the Caribbean, we used the InVEST tool to model ecosystem services for coral reefs, mangroves, and seagrass beds to visualize how these coastal habitats provide benefits in terms of coastal protection and recreation/tourism.
