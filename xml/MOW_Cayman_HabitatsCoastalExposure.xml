      <abstract>These data represents the modeled output of coastal exposure as an index and the affect coral reef, mangrove, and seagrass areas have on reducing that exposure on Grand Cayman. The index was created using the InVEST Coastal Vulnerability model that produces a qualitative estimate of relatively high or low exposure to erosion and inundation during storms. By coupling these results with global population information, the model can show areas along a given coastline where humans are most vulnerable to storm waves and surge. Once vulnerable portions of the coastline have been identified (using a threshold derived from vulnerability), the Coastal Protection Model(s) is used to evaluate the protective benefit of natural coastal protection assets. For the geomorphology file we first used the following shoreline habitats and rankings: Sand Beach (5), Cobble Beach (4), Low Cliff/Rip-Rap Walls (3), Medium Cliff/Small Seawalls (2), Rocky High Cliffs/Seawalls/Mangrove (1). These shoreline types were mapped using heads-up digitizing of high resolution 2013 aerial photography (10cm horizontal resolution). The geomorphology file was then grouped into 3 general classes of mud, rocky/other, and sand. The following protective distances were applied to the natural habitats: Coral Reef (3,000m), Mangrove (3,500m) and Seagrass (500m). All habitats were originally created by the Department of Environment for The National Biodiversity Action Plan for the Cayman Islands (2009) updated using 2013 aerial photography. The method used to create the habitats was a combination of heads up digitizing, supervised classifications, and unsupervised classifications along with extensive field validation. Bathymetry was created using the results of a single-beam survey conducted by the Cayman Islands Department of Lands and Survey with gridded transects of 150 ft (45.7 m) spacing. A LIDAR derived Digital Elevation Model was used for terrestrial elevation. The coastline was represented using heads-up digitizing of high resolution aerial photography. The wave exposure data (wind and wave) came from the WaveWatch III database. Due to the absence of fine-scale population data, the method used to determine population vulnerability was to use building footprints and create a ‘building density’ surface thereby capturing the difference in utilization of areas by residents and the significant number of tourists around the island. Outputs can be used to better understand the relative contributions of these different model variables to coastal exposure and highlight the protective services offered by natural habitats to coastal populations. This information can help coastal managers, planners, landowners and other stakeholders identify regions of greater risk to coastal hazards, which can in turn better inform development strategies and permitting. As the results provide a qualitative representation of erosion and inundation risks rather than quantifying shoreline retreat or inundation limits.</abstract>
      <purpose>These data layers were created by The Nature Conservancy’s Caribbean Program and the University of California-Santz Cruz’s Center for Integrated Spatial Research for the Mapping Ocean Wealth project in October 2015. The goal of this project is to use science, communications, and policy work to visualize and quantify the ocean’s ecosystem, so that we can make smarter investments and decisions for the ocean of tomorrow. In the Caribbean, we used the InVEST tool to model ecosystem services for coral reefs, mangroves, and seagrass beds to visualize how these coastal habitats provide benefits in terms of coastal protection and recreation/tourism.
