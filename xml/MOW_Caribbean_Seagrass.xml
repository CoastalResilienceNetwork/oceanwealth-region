      <abstract>The seagrasses file is a compilation of multiple datasets to arrive at the most up to date data in TNC's database. Regional data was collected to cover as many countries in the CLME region as possible. For seagrasses, this included information from 3 separate datasets: (1.) For the insular Caribbean, the best available information was compiled by Brigham Young University students through a Nature Conservancy contract in 2011. This effort also began with a compilation of various datasets, supplemented with any original digitization efforts. This information was then checked against high resolution satellite imagery where available from Bing and Esri imagery basemaps. Errors and misrepresentations in the base information were modified through heads up digitization from the high resolution imagery. Omissions of coverage were corrected by creating new polygons to match visible seagrass patches. Outside of the insular Caribbean, (2.) the data from the Mesoamerican region was collected in 2007 as well as (3.) the seagrass dataset compiled by the United Nations Environment Programme – World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC) in 2003 in collaboration with Dr. Frederick T. Short at the University of New Hampshire to show the global distribution of seagrass species. The dataset has been developed alongside the publication "World Atlas of Seagrasses" and reflects the opinions of the world's leading seagrass experts with regard to the global distribution of the ecosystem.The regional data was then replaced with sub-regional, national or site level information where this information was available (and wasn't already used in the starting regional file) to obtain a finer scale product. For seagrasses, the following separate datasets were included: (1.) Grenada and St. Vincent and the Grenadines were replaced with data collected from the At the Water’s Edge Project led by the Nature Conservancy. The dataset is compilation of six different datasets. a.) The Ph.D. work of Kim Baldwin at the University of the West Indies Cave Hill and the generation of the Marine Space-use Information System (MarSIS) in 2009 resulted in a benthic habitat file which she created by heads up digitizing effort using 1 meter IKONOS imagery. b.) Work by Matthew Jones as part of The Nature Conservancy contract in the summer of 2011 using Landsat 1999 images. c.) A project dataset shared by the Planning Department of St. Vincent and the Grenadines (SVG) which was developed for the SVG Coastal Resources Inventory System (CRIS). Data was digitized from Landsat 1999 images by Alan Mills and others. d). Brigham Young University students, under contract by the Nature Conservancy, digitized polygons for the country of Grenada using WorldView2 2010 orthophotos. Seagrasses for St. Vincent and the Grenadines were digitized from 2007 aerial photos. e.) A contractor of the Nature Conservancy, Jerry Mitchell, mapped seagrasses for the area surrounding Woburn Clarke's Court Bay, Grenada in 2012. f.) The Grenville area of Grenada and Union Island of St. Vincent and the Grenadines was created through object-oriented mapping using Definiens eCognition software on WorldView2 imagery. (2.) Antigua was replaced with national level benthic habitat data found within TNC's database. The origins and methods of this file are unknown. For Barbuda, IKONOS-2 satellite imagery collected by GeoEye (now DigitalGlobe) in 2012 is the basis for the layer. The product was created through object-oriented mapping using Definiens eCognition software. (3.) The Bahamas were replaced with data from the National Ecological GAP Assessment in 2008. This seagrass layer is a product of a contract between The Nature Conservancy and The University of South Florida (USF). USF grad students used imagery analysis of Landsat 7 and limited ground-truthing data to derive three classes of seagrass - sparse, medium and dense. (4.) The near-coast of Andros Island in the Bahamas was replaced with data created by The Nature Conservancy through a contract with the National Coral Reef Institute for the Global Environmental Facility-funded Integrating Watershed and Coastal Area Management in Caribbean Small Island Developing States (GEF-IWCAM) Project.The habitat layer was derived from RapidEye multispectral satellite data (RapidEye 2010). (5.) Île à Vache, Haiti was replaced with data collected for the Haiti Southwest Sustainable Development Project in 2012. The project utilized well established image-based remote sensing techniques and used a more advanced high-resolution satellite sensor (Worldview-2) and object-based mapping techniques.</abstract>
      <purpose>5 files were created for the Caribbean Large Marine Ecosystem (CLME) Project: Protected Areas, Mangroves, Seagrasses, Beaches, and Coral Reefs. The purpose of the CLME Project was to improve the management of the shared living marine resources -most of which are considered to be fully or partially exploited- among participating countries in the Wider Caribbean Region through an Ecosystem-Based Management (EBM) approach.
