      <abstract>Coral Dispersal ModelWe modelled two coral spawning events per year from 2008 to 2011 with each simulation starting on the last quarter moons of August and September, based on observations of coral mass spawning events. These dates were 23 August 2008, 22 September 2008, 13 August 2009, 12 September 2009, 1 September 2010, 1 October 2010, 21 August 2011, and 20 September 2011.  The dispersal model included the following parameters: time and frequency of spawning, pelagic larval duration, settlement behaviour, and larval mortality influence the dispersal, settlement, and recruitment rates in the model.  In each simulation, the amount of larvae released was proportional to the reef area within each reef unit.  For each simulation, we used a pelagic larval duration (PLD) of 30 days and a mortality rate of 20% day-1. The primary output of each simulation represented an estimate of the total amount of larvae transported between each of the 423 reef units, including local-retention.  We calculated a time-averaged connection strength by averaging the total settled larvae across simulations and the probability of larval dispersal among all reefs.  These values provided all possible reef connections attributed with the originating and destination reef unit ids as well as the modeled larvae settlement and probability estimates.</abstract>
      <purpose>We used NOAA’s Real Time Ocean Forecasting System (RTOFS) ocean circulation model and regional coral reef data to simulate eight coral spawning events from 2008-2011, applying a 30-day pelagic larval duration and 20% mortality rate. Larval dispersal patterns were analyzed between reef units across jurisdictional marine zones in order to identify spatial relationships between larval sources and destinations within countries and territories across the region. Ocean current data were acquired from the NOAA Real-Time Ocean Forecast System (RTOFS) database. RTOFS constitutes predicted circulation values while integrating tidal patterns and is based on the Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM). These data are a basin-scale ocean forecast system for the northern Atlantic and part of the southern Atlantic Ocean, using a variable size grid resolution ranging from 4 to 17 km, and extending from 25°S to 72°N and to 98°W to 16°E. Evaluations of the RTOFS performance indicate that predictions compare well to historical observations at regional scales.</purpose>
